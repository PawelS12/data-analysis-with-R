# Logistic Regression Project

In this project we will be working with the UCI adult dataset. We will be attempting to predict if people in the data set belong in a certain class by salary, either making \<=50k or \>50k per year.

Typically most of your time is spent cleaning data, not running the few lines of code that build your model, this project will try to reflect that by showing different issues that may arise when cleaning data.

# Get the Data

Read in the `adult_sal.csv` file and set it to a data frame called `adult`.

```{r}
adult <- read_csv('adult_sal.csv')
```
