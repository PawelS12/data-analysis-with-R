Add all the necessary libraries to the code chunk below!!!

```{r}

libs <- c("tidyverse", "tidymodels", "vip") # vip for variable importance

installed_libs <- libs %in% rownames(installed.packages())

if (any(installed_libs == FALSE)) {
  install.packages(libs[!installed_libs])
}

# Load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(vip)
```

The main point of this project is to build a model that attempts to
predict count. In this case, we will discover that Linear Regression may
not be the best choice given our data!

# Get the Data

The data has the following features:

*datetime* - hourly date + timestamp *season* - 1 = spring, 2 = summer,
3 = fall, 4 = winter *holiday* - whether the day is considered a holiday
*workingday* - whether the day is neither a weekend nor holiday
*weather* - 1: Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy, Partly cloudy 2: Mist +
Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist 3: Light Snow,
Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered
clouds 4: Heavy Rain + Ice Pallets + Thunderstorm + Mist, Snow + Fog
*temp* - temperature in Celsius *atemp* - "feels like" temperature in
Celsius *humidity* - relative humidity *windspeed* - wind speed
*casual* - number of non-registered user rentals initiated
*registered* - number of registered user rentals initiated *count* -
number of total rentals

# Get the Data

Read in the `adult_sal.csv` file and set it to a data frame called
`adult`.

```{r}
bikes <- read_csv('bikeshare.csv')
```

```{r}
bikes
```
